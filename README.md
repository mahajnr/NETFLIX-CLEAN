# NETFLIX-CLEAN
This project focuses on the systematic cleaning, transformation, and analysis of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Microsoft SQL Server. Raw streaming data often contains inconsistencies such as missing values, unstructured text fields, ambiguous date formats, and duplicated entries, which compromise analytical validity. 
By applying SQL-based data-cleaning techniques including null handling, string standardization, date parsing, and field decomposition this project transformed the dataset into a reliable, structured format suitable for business intelligence. The cleaned data enabled accurate insights into global content trends, genre popularity, regional production patterns, and creator influence, demonstrating how robust SQL workflows can turn messy real-world data into actionable strategic knowledge.
