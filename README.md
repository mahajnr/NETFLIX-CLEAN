# NETFLIX-CLEAN
This project focuses on the systematic cleaning, transformation, and analysis of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Microsoft SQL Server. Raw streaming data often contains inconsistencies such as missing values, unstructured text fields, ambiguous date formats, and duplicated entries, which compromise analytical validity.
